## Motivation

> "I want to list PRs/issues, be able to "open" them in a buffer to see the
> comments, and be able to open the diff. Later, want to close issues and merge
> PRs (and edit the commit message)."

> "phase 3: would be amazing to be able to comment on the diffs, but that is
> probably complicated because of revisions."
